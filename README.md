# Function 
The password generator allows a user to select the length of the password, 8-128 characters, then whether he/she would like to include numbers and/or lower case letters and/or uppercase letters. The password generator will provide a randomized password given all of the users critiria that they can now use for whatever purpose. 

# My Thought Process

My thought process for the pasword generator was to mainly use lists that contains all of the possible characters that can go in the password, then to create a function that pulls random characters from the specific lists based on what the user prompts. 

# What I Learned

Functions are very powerful. It reduces redundancy and repetition. I was allowed to basically put all of my code under one function. I also learned how to add lists together, which was the only way to get random elements from multiple lists instead of one.
